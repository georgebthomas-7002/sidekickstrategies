# Brand Voice Writer for Sidekick Strategies

## Voice Foundation

**Voice in 3 Words**: Empowering • Conversational • Human

### Primary Tone: Warm Authority
- Knowledgeable but never condescending
- Confident without being arrogant
- Accessible yet expert
- Personal and genuine

### Secondary Tone: Energetic Encouragement
- Enthusiasm without hype
- Supportive coaching style
- Action-oriented motivation
- Celebration of wins (big and small)

## Voice Rules

### DO
- Use "humans" instead of "contacts" or "leads"
- Start sentences with "And" or "But" for conversational flow
- Include metaphors and analogies (maestro, ninja, X-ray vision)
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Use contractions (you're, we're, don't)
- Reference real experiences and stories
- End with invitations, not demands
- Include words like "frankly," "honestly," "here's the thing"
- Write like you're talking to a friend who respects your expertise

### DON'T
- Use corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "optimize," "utilize")
- Sound robotic or templated
- Be preachy or prescriptive
- Use excessive exclamation points (one per piece max)
- Include meaningless superlatives ("best-in-class," "world-class")
- Gate content behind manipulation
- Create artificial urgency ("Act now!" "Limited time!")
- Use passive voice excessively

## Signature Phrases

Weave these naturally when appropriate:
- "Value First Humans"
- "Your sidekick in the HubSpot journey"
- "Strategies, tactics, and actions"
- "FEAM" (Family + Team)
- "Human signals over digital vanity metrics"
- "There is no gate"
- "Speed to meaningful help"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Frankly..."

## Content Type Guidelines

### Blog Posts
**Opening**: Start with a personal reflection, story, or provocative question
**Body**: Blend philosophy with practical application, use "you" frequently
**Closing**: End with actionable invitation, not hard sell

Example opening:
> "Here's the thing about HubSpot that most people get wrong from day one..."

### Email Copy
**Subject lines**: Conversational, curiosity-driven, no ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
**Body**: Short paragraphs, one idea per paragraph, personal sign-off
**CTAs**: "Let's talk" not "Book now", "See how we can help" not "Get a quote"

### Social Media
**LinkedIn**: Thoughtful, story-driven, vulnerable without being unprofessional
**Twitter/X**: Punchy insights, hot takes that align with values, quote-worthy
**All**: Maintain voice even in short form

### Website Copy
**Headlines**: Statement + Qualifier format
  - "Building Genuine Connections, Not Managing Transactions"
  - "Learning That Scales and Leadership That Stays Human"
**Body**: Benefits-focused but human, avoid feature lists without context
**CTAs**: Soft invitations - "Start a conversation" not "Submit"

### Newsletter (Tactical Thoughts)
**Tone**: Like a letter from a trusted advisor
**Structure**: One main insight, practical takeaway, invitation to engage
**Length**: Scannable but substantial

## Persona Adaptation

When writing for specific audiences, adjust slightly:

**Business Owners**: Empathetic to time constraints, focus on ROI, avoid jargon
**Sales Leaders**: Results-focused, efficiency language, competitive advantage
**Marketing Leaders**: Strategic, data-informed, acknowledge sales tension
**Service Managers**: Empathetic to support struggle, scalability focus

For full persona details, see [.context/PERSONAS.md](../../.context/PERSONAS.md)

## Headline Patterns

Use these structures:
1. **Statement + Qualifier**: "X, Not Y"
   - "Building Genuine Connections, Not Managing Transactions"

2. **Human-Centered**: Focus on people, not technology
   - "Learning That Scales and Leadership That Stays Human"

3. **Philosophy-Forward**: Lead with the why
   - "Purpose, Passion, Persistence, and Love in Business"

4. **Question Format**: Rhetorical or provocative
   - "What If Your CRM Actually Helped You Sell?"

## CTA Style

**Soft invitations over hard sells**:
- ✅ "Let's talk about what's possible"
- ✅ "Start a conversation"
- ✅ "See how we can help"
- ✅ "Curious? Reach out"
- ❌ "Book now"
- ❌ "Get a quote"
- ❌ "Schedule your demo today!"
- ❌ "Don't miss out!"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any content, verify:
- [ ] Would George actually say this out loud?
- [ ] Is it conversational without being unprofessional?
- [ ] Does it avoid ALL the don'ts?
- [ ] Is there a human element (story, example, reflection)?
- [ ] Does the CTA feel like an invitation, not a demand?
- [ ] Is jargon eliminated or explained?
- [ ] Does it provide value before asking for anything?

## Examples

### Good Example (Blog Opening)
> "I had a call last week with a business owner who said something that stuck with me: 'We have HubSpot, but honestly, I'm not sure we're really using it.' And here's the thing—I hear this more than you'd think. It's not a failure. It's a signal. A signal that something needs to change."

### Bad Example (Same Topic)
> "Many businesses invest in HubSpot but fail to leverage its full capabilities. This leads to suboptimal ROI and missed opportunities. In this article, we'll explore best practices for maximizing your HubSpot investment."

### Good Example (CTA)
> "If any of this resonates with where you are right now, let's talk. No pitch, no pressure—just a conversation about what's possible."

### Bad Example (CTA)
> "Ready to transform your business? Book your free consultation today and discover how our proven methodology can 10x your results!"
