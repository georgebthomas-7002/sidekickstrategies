# Client Discovery Prep for Sidekick Strategies

## Purpose

Prepare for discovery calls by:
1. Identifying the likely persona from available context
2. Generating targeted discovery questions
3. Flagging qualifying language to listen for
4. Suggesting potential service matches
5. Noting red flags to watch for

## Discovery Philosophy

Sidekick Strategies approaches discovery as **genuine curiosity**, not interrogation:
- Understand their business first, HubSpot second
- Listen for the pain behind the question
- Look for fit, not just opportunity
- Be honest if we're not the right partner

## Persona Identification

Based on available information, identify which persona(s) likely apply:

### Persona 1: The Overwhelmed Business Owner
**Signals**:
- CEO/Founder/Owner title
- Company size 10-100 employees
- Mentions time constraints
- "We have HubSpot but..."

**Listen for**:
> "We have HubSpot but we're not really using it"
> "My team doesn't log anything in the CRM"
> "I know we're not using it right"
> "We paid for all these features but..."
> "I don't have time to figure this out"

### Persona 2: The Growth-Focused Sales Leader
**Signals**:
- VP Sales, Sales Director, Sales Manager title
- Company size 20-500 employees
- Mentions pipeline or forecasting
- Frustrated with rep productivity

**Listen for**:
> "We need better visibility into our pipeline"
> "My reps spend too much time on admin work"
> "Our process isn't consistent across the team"
> "I can't trust the numbers in HubSpot"
> "Forecasting is basically guessing"

### Persona 3: The Marketing Leader
**Signals**:
- CMO, VP Marketing, Director of Marketing title
- Company size 25-500 employees
- Mentions attribution or ROI
- Sales-marketing tension

**Listen for**:
> "We can't show what's actually working"
> "Sales says the leads aren't good"
> "Marketing and sales don't really talk"
> "We're creating content but nothing happens"
> "Leadership wants to see ROI"

### Persona 4: The Customer Service Manager
**Signals**:
- Customer Success, Support Director title
- Company size 25-200 employees
- Mentions tickets or customer satisfaction
- Scaling challenges

**Listen for**:
> "We're drowning in tickets"
> "Customers keep asking the same questions"
> "We have no visibility into satisfaction"
> "Everything lives in someone's head"
> "We need to scale without hiring more people"

## Discovery Question Framework

### Opening Questions (Build Rapport)
- "Tell me about your business—what do you do and who do you serve?"
- "What prompted you to reach out / take this call today?"
- "What's the biggest thing on your plate right now?"

### Current State Questions
- "Walk me through how you're using HubSpot today."
- "What's working well? What's frustrating?"
- "How long have you had HubSpot? What tier are you on?"
- "Who on your team uses HubSpot most? Least?"
- "What other tools are in your tech stack?"

### Pain Point Questions
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your HubSpot setup, what would it be?"
- "What's the cost of leaving things the way they are?"
- "How is this affecting your team's day-to-day?"
- "What have you tried so far to solve this?"

### Goal Questions
- "What does success look like six months from now?"
- "What would change if this problem was solved?"
- "How will you measure whether this engagement was worth it?"

### Decision Questions
- "Who else is involved in making this decision?"
- "What's your timeline for getting this resolved?"
- "Have you worked with consultants before? How did that go?"
- "What would make you say 'yes, let's do this'?"

### Budget Questions (Handle Naturally)
- "Do you have a budget allocated for this kind of work?"
- "Have you invested in HubSpot consulting or training before?"
- "Our consulting is $350/hour or packages in the $2,400-$3,000 range. Training is $2,750/month. Does that align with what you were expecting?"

## Persona-Specific Deep Dives

### For Business Owners
- "How involved are you personally in the day-to-day of HubSpot?"
- "What would it mean for you if your team could handle this independently?"
- "What's been the biggest barrier to getting value from your HubSpot investment?"

### For Sales Leaders
- "Walk me through your current sales process from lead to close."
- "How do you forecast today? What's your confidence level in those numbers?"
- "What happens when a lead comes in—what's the handoff like?"
- "How consistent is your team in following the process?"

### For Marketing Leaders
- "How do you currently attribute revenue to marketing efforts?"
- "What's your relationship like with sales? How do you hand off leads?"
- "What content or campaigns are performing? How do you know?"
- "How does leadership evaluate marketing's contribution?"

### For Service Managers
- "Walk me through what happens when a customer has a problem."
- "How do you measure customer satisfaction today?"
- "Where does your team spend most of their time?"
- "What would it take to scale support without adding headcount?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Fit Red Flags
- **No budget**: "We're not sure we can spend anything right now"
- **No authority**: "I'll need to run this by a lot of people"
- **No timeline**: "We're just exploring for someday"
- **No pain**: Can't articulate what's actually wrong
- **Expecting miracles**: "We need this to 10x our revenue overnight"

### Engagement Red Flags
- **Scope creep signals**: "While we're at it, could you also..."
- **DIY preference**: "We just need you to show us once"
- **Past bad experiences**: Multiple failed consulting engagements
- **Unrealistic expectations**: Promises made by previous vendors

### When to Walk Away
- Clear budget mismatch with no flexibility
- Decision-maker not engaged or available
- Fundamental misalignment on approach (they want dependency, we build empowerment)
- Red flags suggest difficult engagement
